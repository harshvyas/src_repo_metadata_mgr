# GitHub to Sourcegraph Repo Metadata Synchronizer

The GitHub to Sourcegraph Repository Metadata Synchronizer is a Python script designed to streamline the synchronization of repository metadata from GitHub to Sourcegraph instances. This script utilizes API clients for GitHub and Sourcegraph to retrieve GitHub repository metadata and synchronize it with corresponding Sourcegraph repositories.

With this script, you can effortlessly keep the metadata in your Sourcegraph repositories up to date with changes made in the associated GitHub repositories. It fetches existing metadata from GitHub, such as repository topics and performs a one-way synchronization to ensure consistency between the platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- API tokens for GitHub and Sourcegraph. Set these tokens as environment variables:
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the GitHub API token
  - `SOURCEGRAPH_TOKEN` for the Sourcegraph API token
- The Sourcegraph instance has the `repository-metadata` feature flag enabled in the `site-admin` settings. This flag allows the synchronization of repository metadata between GitHub and Sourcegraph.
- The user executing the script has the necessary permissions on the Sourcegraph instance to perform mutation queries. These permissions are required to update metadata on Sourcegraph repositories.
- If needed, modify the `github/input-query.gql` file to customize the GitHub repository metadata query. By default, the script syncs topics from GitHub to corresponding keys in Sourcegraph. Adjust the query as per your specific metadata requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/harshvyas/src_repo_metadata_mgr.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd src_repo_metadata_mgr 
```
3. Install python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

‚ùØ python main.py --help
Usage: main.py [OPTIONS] [SEARCH_STRING]

- By default synchronizes the first 10 search results for the string
  "sourcegraph" in any github repos available in your Sourcegraph instance. 
- Passing specific string will narrow synchronization to the first 10 search results
  in any github repos available in your Sourcegraph instance. 
- Use --repos owner1/repo1,owner2/repo2 to explicity synchronize specific repos
- Default is preview mode, to trigger synchronization pass --sync

- Options:
    -s, --sync        Execute the synchronization
    -r, --repos TEXT  Comma-separated list of github repositories to sync in
                      format ownername/reponame e.g.
                      sourcegraph/sourcegraph,sourcegraph/src-cli
    --help            Show this message and exit.

## Examples

1. Preview Github repos available in your Sourcegraph instance that match the search string "hello world":

```
python main.py "hello world"
```

2. Sync specific repositories:

```
python main.py --sync --repos sourcegraph/sourcegraph,sourcegraph/src-cli
```

## TODO

- [ ] Implement pagination logic to handle more than the first 10 repositories.
- [ ] Rate limit for both api's needs to be handled.
- [ ] Add error handling and logging to provide more informative error messages.
- [ ] Include additional metadata fields from GitHub to sync with Sourcegraph.
- [ ] Create unit tests to ensure the script's functionality and prevent regressions.
- [ ] Add support for other code hosting platforms besides GitHub.
- [ ] Improve the command-line interface to provide more options and better user experience.
- [ ] Refactor the code to enhance modularity and reusability.
- [ ] Update the script to work with the latest API versions of GitHub and Sourcegraph.
